# Kultra-Mega-Stores-Inventory-PROJECT
This is a complete Analysis documentation on the project Kultra-Mega-Stores-Inventory with Digital Skillup Africa (DSA).

This is my first project as a practical handson to validate the extent of the understanding of the classes i had with DSA. From the training, I find SQL classes most easier followed by Power-BI and this gives me the confidence to start with the SQL project first.

## Project Topic: E commerce Sales Analysis

### Project Overview
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E commerce project over the past year.
By analysing the various parameters in the data received, we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.
